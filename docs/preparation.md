## [Lessons 1 and 2] Create a GitHub account 
- (optional) Watch the short introductory video[What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E).
- Navigate to [Github](https://github.com) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one. 
- After registering, sign in to your account.

## [Lesson 2] Install and configure git & GitHub Desktop

### Install git version control software
- Navigate to the [official git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions to download and install for your operating system.
  - For Windows, use [this download link](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install using all of the default (recommended) options.

### Install and configure GitHub Desktop
If using a Windows or Mac, download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- More guidance can be found in guides from [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) and [TechRepublic](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-github-desktop/).
- Sign into GitHub Desktop using your GitHub credentials
- In the *Configure Git* page, enter the name and email address that you want associated with your changes
- In File > Options > Advanced, set the Shell to Git Bash
- (optional) Once configured, the main GitHub Desktop page will show any repositories that exist in your GitHub account. For those who use git already, you can add any local repositories that already exist on your machine.

**If you are a Linux user**, GitHub Desktop will not work for you. Instead, you'll need to learn how to use git and git Bash. Separate instructions are provided in Lesson 2.
